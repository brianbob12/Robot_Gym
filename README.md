# Robot_Gym(unfinished)
 A platformer where you are aided by clones learning from your behaviour. 
 I plan to implement double deep Q learning for the clone's control. 
 The agents will receive reward for:
 * Generally doing well in the game
    * Progressing in levels
    * Killing enemies
    * Not dying
* Doing actions similar to what the player did
